You only have 10 seconds to answer this question!
*question: How much is *1+3*?

		>>scoreQuestion3 = 1
	5
		>>scoreQuestion3 = 0
		Wrong. Try again!
		*goto: 1+3
	6
		>>scoreQuestion3 = 0
		Wrong. Try again!
		*goto: 1+3

--This builds on the same code as above to give the participant two attempts.
--*while means that everything indented underneath it will loop as long as its condition is true.
--This one will loop until the user has attempted twice. {attempts} starts out as equaling 1, but after they get the wrong answer, it will change {attempts} to 2.
-- --If the user gets it wrong the second time, {attempts} goes to 3 and the *while loop is over.
-- >>attempt = 1
-- *while: attempt < 3 
-- 	*label: 2*2
-- 	*question: How much is 2*2? You have two attempts
