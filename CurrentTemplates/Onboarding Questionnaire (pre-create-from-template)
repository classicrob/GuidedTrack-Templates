One of GuidedTrack's greatest strengths is in the choose-your-own-adventure like control you have over how your program flows. /Short of a full-blown programming language like JavaScript or Python, no alternative gives you the same flexibility./

It is easy to get started with GuidedTrack and you can learn as you go. Things may start out slower than you're used to in other apps, but as you gain familiarity, you'll be able to write a program as fast as you can type. /No app that requires you to click and drag a million little things can beat that speed of creation./

In a minute, we are going to send you into a basic program you can edit that will teach you all you need to get started.
