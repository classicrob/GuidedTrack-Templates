*header: Welcome to GuidedTrack

We help non-coders and coders alike create interactive courses, apps, surveys, and experiments based on their own subject matter expertise.

Right now you are seeing your first program made in GuidedTrack. *You can write something just like this!* 

That's right. *You just write.*

*button: Go on...

*header: Everything you know and love about text editors works here

You can copy, paste, select an arbitrary amount of text, and more. You can even do fancy stuff, like using multiple cursors.

The only limit to your speed is how fast you can type. Nothing that requires you to click buttons and then type can possibly be faster.

*button: But what can I do with it?

Anything you want. Seriously. It's extremely unlikely that you'll stop being able to do stuff.

*button: Next

And you'll be able to write programs before you even know how with our templates and and toolbar.
