--{Tracker App Template (intermediate)}
--This program tracks the calories a person eats in a day. Use it to create apps to track the number of miles you run per week, minutes spent reading every day, etc...https://www.guidedtrack.com/programs/j9gdyqh/preview

--Here we have a calorie tracker app. The user opens it up, sees a chart showing their calories today and yesterday, and can add more. Press preview, try it out!

--The first time that a user runs the program, they have not logged in any calories.
>>totalCalories = 0
	--This is the total amount of calories the user has logged. We'll update this for each entry.
	--Since people are new to using the calorie tracker at this point, it's 0
>>caloriesYesterday = 0
	--This is how many calories the user consumed yesterday.
	--Since people are new to using the calorie tracker at this point, it's 0
