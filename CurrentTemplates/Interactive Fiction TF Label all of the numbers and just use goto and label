--In this template, all of the questions have labels. This is by no means required, but it makes it easy to have a flow with skip logic.
--For example, "*goto: 5" will take the participant from wherever they are to where you see *label: 5
*label: 1
*question: They're here. Oh God! They've found you!
	Run
		--indenting *picture under a multiple choice question response will give the response an image
		*picture: https://images.typeform.com/images/fbGc73wzzkvH/image/default
		--Answering "Run" just moves you on to the next question down in this program
	Hide
		*picture: https://images.typeform.com/images/h7zbF7tXrAF6/image/default
		*goto: 4
		--If you select "Hide" then the *goto means you jump to *label: 4

*label: 2
*question: Their vision is based on movement, they give chase.
	Keep running
		--Here we don't need to *goto anywhere, because it will just automatically move to the next question down in the program.
		--If you wanted, you could put *goto here anyway. If you did, you could use [[Mac, CTRL+F] [PC, CTRL+F]] to search for a label's value to quickly see how you got there and where you're going.
