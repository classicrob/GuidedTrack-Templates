	GuidedTrack is an ideal platform for social scientists who collect data online. It offers a flexibility and efficiency that I have not encountered in any other survey platforms. That said, you definitely don’t need any background in programming! The help guide has great tips and examples, and the customer support is excellent.
	-Alexa H, PhD Candidate
	
	I ran all my studies for my PhD using GuidedTrack, and it really helped me to do so quickly and easily. The language is intuitive and quick to learn, with clear instructions - so it's easy to get started and learn as you go. If I had any difficulties using the platform, I got a fast and helpful response to my questions.

	"GuidedTrack seems to be the teaching system I've been searching for. Most course systems nudge creators toward content dumping and quizzing. GuidedTrack enables learning adventures. I can decide where students go next based on their answers. The great thing about GuidedTrack is that I can add rich content by merely pointing and clicking, and edit through typing, or cut and paste."

	Other entrepreneurs have nice things to say about GuidedTrack:
	
	GuidedTrack is a transformative tool for early-stage ventures! It allows you to build custom apps in a fraction of the typical time and cost. It's perfect for quickly prototyping and iterating new products. I think of it as the Wordpress for apps – you no longer need any coding experience to build your own apps, with access to powerful programming abilities.

--so based on a userGoal and userRole we preload different templates into the person's account, or we can do softer personalization like I have in lines 53-57
--If we're going to do this like here, then I need some way to easily show recommendations for the different templates based on difficulty.
