--I think that if I want to have a long scrollable list, I need to do a while loop
	--Maybe I need to just log each one as "1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6..." if I want to do this
		--I'm gonna have to do it this way, and do it with an association where the component can call, say, thisMoment for 1 with the keys for it.
