*question: They're here. Oh God! They've found you!
	Run
		*question: Their vision is based on movement, they give chase.
			Keep running
			Give in
	Hide
		*question: There's a pile of rubble you can squeeze under. A metal object glints faintly. 
			Examine
			Stay hidden
	
*question: They're fast, too fast. They're catching up.
	Turn and fight
	Hide
	

	
*question: Your heart beats so loudly, you're sure they'll hear. An hour passes.
	Wait
	Look around
	
*question: Suddenly you jerk awake! How much time has passed? It is night.
	Stay hidden
	Leave
	
*question: They've gone. Slowly, you creep out. Blood is smeared on the streets. You are tired.
	Give in
	Weep
	
*question: Pitch black night. No moon. No stars. 
	Switch on torch
	Call out for help
	
*question: Nothing left to lose! You cry out. Your voice echoes but there is no answer.
	Give in
	Weep
	
*question: Tears stream down your cheeks. You're utterly alone. Are you the last one left?
	Give in
	Carry on
	
*question: Devoid of energy, you stumble down one dark alley after another. Everything is miserable. You come across a door slightly ajar.
	Go inside
	Keep walking
	
*question: Death will not find you. They *enjoy* the chase. With a last burst of energy, you run. You hear them shift. Their claws scrape the ground. You trip.
	Get up
	Surrender
	
*question: The creature chasing you is... young! Its teeth look brittle.
	Fight
	Reason with it
	
*question: You turn down a street just as desolate as the others. Immediate regret. The creature stares at you without blinking.
	Punch it in the mouth
	Try to reason with it
	
*question: "Why?" you scream, "Why?". It pauses, then replies. "Because you deserve it."
	You do
	You don't
	
*question: It won't listen to your lies. It slithers closer. 
	Fight
	Plead
