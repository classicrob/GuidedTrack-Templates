*header: Welcome to GuidedTrack

We help non-coders and coders alike create interactive courses, apps, surveys, and experiments based on their own subject matter expertise.

Right now you are seeing your first program made in GuidedTrack. *You can write something just like this!* 

That's right. *You just write.*

*header: Everything you know and love about text editors works here. The only limit to your speed is how fast you can type.

You can copy, paste, select an arbitrary amount of text, and more. You can even do fancy stuff, like using multiple cursors.

Nothing that requires you to click buttons and then type can possibly be faster.

*button: But what can I do with it?

GuidedTrack is more powerful and flexible than any other app on the market. It won't take long to get started, and the sky is the limit.

You'll be able to write programs before you even know how with our templates and and toolbar.
